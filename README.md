## About

#### Using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL, this terminal application allows a business owner to keep track of their departments, the roles within those departments, the employees who fill those roles, the managers who oversee those employees and the salaries each of them get paid! Better yet, the application is designed so that each employee can be updated and have their management adjusted as needed in order to keep track with promotions and changes of position or department, as needed.

## Installation:

Utilizing the Application is simple!

First, clone the repo:
    
    git clone git@github.com:jmabie94/3-9-23-Employee-Tracker.git

Next, open an integrated terminal in your cloned folder and do the following:
    
    run npm init -y
    run npm i

After Node Packages have installed, open your MySQL:
    ```mb
    mysql -u root -p
    *enter your password*
    SOURCE db/schema.sql
    SOURCE db/seeds.sql (optional, if you'd like a simple example roster of employees to start with)
    exit
    ```

Finally, after exiting MySQL:

    run node index.js

Then, utilize the Inquirer Prompts in your terminal to freely customize your workforce database!

## Notes for Grading Team:
I still intend to add functionality so that you can search Budgets by Department, improve the View Employees functionality to also show Managers and not just employees with managers, add an update Department Role functionality so that if a new department is a better match for a role currently within another the role can be switched, as well as functionality to delete departments, roles and employees as necessary. This is the first assignment where I've been drastically late turning it in (as I found it noticeably more challenging than anything else presented so far during this bootcamp) so I'm submitting this now that I have all the base requirements working, and will update in coming weeks.
